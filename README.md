# Story of this game 📖
--------------------------


This game was developed for a **prestigious competition in Saudi Arabia** with a grand prize of **$150,000**. Unfortunately, I can’t recall the name of the competition, but it stands out as a significant milestone in my journey. The development time was set to just **two months**, and despite our best efforts, we were unable to complete it on time.

This project was particularly special because it marked my first experience working with a **team of 8 talented individuals**, including **6 developers** and dedicated **artists and sound designers**. Collaborating with such a diverse team allowed me to grow both professionally and personally, as we tackled challenges together and brought creative ideas to life.

Though we didn’t make it to the finish line, the entire journey was an incredible learning experience. It not only sharpened my technical skills but also gave me a deep appreciation for teamwork and the collaborative spirit required to create something amazing. In the end, it was an unforgettable experience that I cherish deeply.
